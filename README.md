# Linagora
Android application apply clean architecture.

  - Clean architecture with MVVM
  - Using Coroutine and retrofit for calling asynchronous restful API
  - Data binding, live data
  - Inversion of code with Koin
  
## For runing this application:
  - Pull source code, open with Android studio and sync gradle
  - Put right API_URL at: build.gradle (app level). Currently, backend is running on free Heroku server, so speed should be slow.
  
## Have fun :)
