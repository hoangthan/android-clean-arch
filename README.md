# Linagora
Android application apply clean architecture with MVVM

  - Clean architecture with MVVM
  - Using Coroutine and retrofit for calling asynchronous restful API
  - Data binding, live data
  - Inversion of code with Koin
  
## For running this application:
  - Pull source code, open with Android studio and sync gradle
  - Put right API_URL at: build.gradle (app level). Currently, backend is running on free Heroku server, so speed should be slow.
  - For testing: Call API from: https://tranquil-retreat-88528.herokuapp.com/api/users to get an username
## Have fun :)
